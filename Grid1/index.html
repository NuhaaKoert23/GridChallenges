                <p>the best I can be. I am Nuhaa Daniels and it's time I start appreciating myself for who I am, for who I was and for I want to be. Throughout my life, picking up the broken pieces was never an issue and this made me a stronger person towards life. I've lost many throughout my journey and I know I'm still gonna loose plenty more. I have been through so much and it still hasn't changed my end goal. I have very few to appreciate for who I am today but the person I am most grateful is MYSELF.</p>
